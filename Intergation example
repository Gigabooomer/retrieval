I found a couple of GitHub repositories that showcase multi-model integration in a LangChain LLM app, which should be very helpful for your project:
	1.	LLM_ChatBot by aijadugar:
This project integrates multiple large language models (LLMs) using the LangChain framework. It includes models like OpenAI’s GPT and Hugging Face’s T5 to perform various NLP tasks such as answering questions about world leaders, suggesting travel destinations, and generating synonyms. This repository demonstrates a practical implementation of integrating different models within a single application framework.
